Hi there, I'm Eli Gundry and I think the title says everything you need
to know about me. I love everything to be as simple as possible. Simple
life leads to less stress. A simple design is easy to understand, even
though it may not be apprciated. Simple, reusable code is easy to work
with and parse.

## What exactly is a full stack web developer, anyways?

I get this question a lot and I should probably elaborate on this.
A full stack web developer is one that feels just as comfortable working
with front end web code as they do working with server side code. I feel
extremely confident developing web apps, regardless if I'm fighting
JavaScript in Internet Explorer, adding features to a PHP web
application, or even writing database queries.

## Quick Facts About Eli

* Tabs over spaces.
* Vim over Emacs.
* Linux, OS X, Windows. In that order.
* I do all my programming in a terminal.
* The Browns will win a Super Bowl in my life time.
