  <h2>Glad To Meet You!</h2>
  <p>My name is Eli I only really write in lists, so here's my deal.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I am a {% emojiText "üßë‚Äçüíª", "computer programmer emoji", "<strong>full stack web engineer</strong>" %}.
    </li>
    <li>
      I love to plan and {% emojiText "üë®‚Äçüç≥", "chef emoji", "<strong>cook elaborate meals</strong>" %}. It really
      activates the engineering part of my brain!
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a {% emojiText "ü§ì", "geek emoji", "<strong>non-traditional computer science education</strong>" %}.
      I attended a vocational school in high school, taught myself web programming, bounced around colleges for computer
      science while working the entire time before deciding to go pro!
    </li>
    <li>
      I am a <strong>Vim user</strong> but I actively encourage everyone to use something else. Using Vim in {% currentYear %}
      is a cool bar trick.
    </li>
    <li>
      I currently live in {% emojiText "üìç", "pin emoji to denote location", "<strong>Astoria, Queens</strong>" %}.
      I didn't think I would settle down in Queens and love it as much as I do, but life is like that sometimes.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a {% emojiText "üòº", "smirking cat emoji because Fonzie is a stinker", "<strong>fat cat named Fonzie</strong>" %}
      and I sorta have a <a href="https://twitter.com/EliGundry/status/1055933062125703168">a tattoo of him on my arm</a>.
    <li>
  </ul>

<section class="feeling">
  <h2>How I'm Feeling</h2>
  <p>
    A while ago, I decided to start journaling my feelings. Being a software engineer,
    <a href="/blog/feelings-api">I made an API out of it and put it on my website</a>. The favicon for the site the
    emoji for my latest entry.

<section class="coding">
  <h2>Do You Code?</h2>
  <p>
    I make a living developing web applications. I jump all around the stack and will do whatever it takes to ship. Need
    me to do some devops to get this feature out? I gotcha. Some CSS is making a button look bad? I'll do my best.
    A query running to slow? Stop, I can't deal with all this excitement.
  </p>
  <p>
    GitHub contribution calendars are not a good indicator of whether or not someone is a good developer, but they are
    very pretty.

<section class="reading">
  <h2>What I'm Reading</h2>
  <p>
    I wish I read more, but there are only so many hours in the day. These are the books that I'm reading right now. You
    can find me on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29665939-eli-gundry" itemprop="sameAs">Goodreads</a>.

<section class="listening">
  <h2>What I'm Listening To</h2>
  <p>
    I listen to way too much music and I love to listen to full albums. I mainly listen to hip hop, indie rock and <a href="/blog/icymi-glocca-morra-just-married"><abbr title="Ask me about the fun 5th wave emo bands I love">emo</abbr></a>.
    I occasionally write reviews of old albums that I love but aren't well known in a series called <a href="/tags/icymi"><abbr title="I See You Missed It">ICYMI</abbr></a>.
