# Outline

* I listen to way too much music
  * My favorite thing to do it listen to a full album. There isn't a better way to experience an artist's vision than
    that.
* Spotify used to be a good way for me to find things, has failed me in recent years.
  * It doesn't understand that I want music unlike what I've listened to. I need new things!
  * I wrecked it's recommendations with the amount of ambient music I've listened to while falling asleep over the
    years.
* I find music from Pitchfork and other publications
* I suffer from decision paralysis
  * Shout out @neilzo's lunch roulette thing from years ago
* [album-mode.party](https://album-mode.party)
  * I needed an app where I can push buttons and get an album to listen to
  * It started with searching by label and being able to get a random album from Pitchfork reviews
    * I ended up scraping minmal amounts of data on reviews into a sqlite database that I ship with the code
  * Had a "no, duh" moment about 2 weeks in about being able to search via genre and artist
    * Genre in Spotify is super interesting. They don't list it anywhere and I had to pull it from this random Spotify
      research site who's purpose I really don't understand, someone please explain it to me!
      * https://everynoise.com/everynoise1d.cgi?scope=all
* Remix
  * My new job at Chord is developer tooling on headless applications
  * This app gave me an excuse to pick up Remix
  * Reminds me a lot of PHP
    * Your layout code is right beneath your data code
    * File organization is like a refined first PHP project
    * Hosting was somehow simpler than FTPing PHP files, even though there is a build step!
    * Really nice integration with Netlify
