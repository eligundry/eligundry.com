# Outline

* I listen to way too much music
* Spotify used to be a good way for me to find things, has failed me in recent years.
  * It doesn't understand that I want music unlike what I've listened to. I need new things!
* Remix
  * My new job at Chord is developer tooling on headless applications
  * This app gave me an excuse to pick up Remix
  * Reminds me a lot of PHP
    * Your layout code is right beneath your data code
    * File organization is like a refined first PHP project
    * Hosting was somehow simpler than FTPing PHP files, even though there is a build step!
