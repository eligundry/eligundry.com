		# I'm a simple man in a complex world&hellip;

		Hi there, I'm Eli Gundry and I think the title says everything you need
		to know about me. I love everything to be as simple as possible. Simple
		life leads to less stress. A simple design is easy to understand, even
		though it may not be apprciated. Simple, reusable code is easy to work
		with and parse.

		## What exactly is a full stack web developer, anyways?

		I get this question a lot and I should probably elaborate on this.
		A full stack web developer is one that feels just as comfortable working
		with front end web code as they do working with server side code. I feel
		extremely confident developing web apps, regardless if I'm fighting
		JavaScript in Internet Explorer, adding features to a PHP web
		application, or even writing database queries.
