    <p>
      there is a lot of buzz around web2 vs web3. a lot of discussion around
      ownership and data. these are healthy discussions for web professionals to
      have. for me, tho, web3 seems to be a bunch of librarian grifters trying
      to shoehorn ayn randian solutions as the one true way for
      decentralization. when i think of decentralization, i think of bittorrent
      and information freedom, not artificial scarcity and laser eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      what i can agree with in web3 is ownership of data and the best way to
      express that is by having a personal site. you own all the pixels that you
      can show. you can write pretty much whatever you want and not worry about
      censorship. this has been around for nearly 30 years! all you need to do
      is write a little html and push it to a server and boom, you're
      communicating. this what the <a href="http://html.energy">web0</a> is all
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      while i enjoy making <abbr title="Single Page Applications">SPAs</abbr>,
      sometimes it's soothing to code like my forefathers & foremothers once
      did. write that html without any javascript. let that text use the default
      fonts. really focus on your ideas instead of flash. i had a ball making
      this page. won't you join me and the web0 movement?

        I have with my brother in law for HTML Day 2025. I dislike AI art in
        general, but I wanted this to have some polish, so I cheated.<br />
        <br />
        My wife and I traveled to Poughkeepsie for this event and she wrote her
        first HTML ever! It is a treasured memory of mine now.

        <a href="/horses.html">Horses</a>: A poem I made for HTML Day 2024 about
        my first (web) job working at a horse farm. I remeber them telling me,
        when they hired me, that the last person they had ended up in NYC and
        look at me now.
