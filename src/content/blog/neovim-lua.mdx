!["Friendship ended with Vimscript, Now Lua is my best friend" meme](../../assets/img/neovim-lua/friendship-ended-with-vimscript.png)

Looking over my notes for this post, it seems like I've been using Vim in some sort or another for over a decade at this
point? Time flies when you can't `:quit` Vim. Folks, I'll be here all week.

I guess I switched to Neovim at some point in 2014? One of the main reasons that Neovim exists is that mainline Vim,
historically, resisted allowing configuration in languages that were not Vimscript. Vimscript is‚Ä¶ not a good language.
People that love it, love it, all the more power to them, but I am not one of them. I recall at some point during my
mainline Vim days using some plugins that were written in Python, but those seem to break all the time.

All this time though, I have been maintaining a [very detailed and commented Vim config in Vimscript](https://github.com/eligundry/dots/blob/b6ec01b9fefb3d2883d12ffa2676e9fb1b6a6d48/config/nvim/init.vim).
I have put a lot of sweat equity into this config! Perfecting it got me fired from a job in 2012. Lesson learned, you
move on. I even kept it backwards compatible with ancient versions of Vim that I will never encounter in reality. It was fun and made me feel
like a hacker. I would see people on Reddit talking about their configs in Lua and I would just tune them out. I have
my config and it's already held together with Popsicle sticks and glue. If I even look at it wrong, I'll lose a day of
development time.

At some point in 2018, I discovered [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and it was a revelation. It was added
Visual Studio Code's basic code completion features to my super custom Vim config! I could jump to definition!
I could have accurate code completion! It probably does a lot more IDE like things, but I'm a simple man and that's
all I need. My config would still break from time to time, but at least I became 1.3x more efficient.

[I started working at Chord in 2022](/blog/job-search-2k22) and discovered that, for the first time, I had coworkers
that used Vim! I started a little `#vim` channel and we got to sharing tips and configs. It's always nice to find
people like you.

On a Friday evening in November, [Chad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadnickell/) posts his brand new Neovim config
written in Lua. Well that just pushed all of us over the Lua cliff and we all spent our weekend updating our configs.

[**You can checkout how I did this in this pull request!**](https://github.com/eligundry/dots/pull/7)

Chad's [base config](https://github.com/nickell/yadm/commit/5cc342cb5637294506421742b155a4db44b6c4fb) was a great base
that I was able crib into my config as I converted it to Lua. It had all the code completion plugins that I needed to
replace coc.nvim. At this point, he had his configs in a bunch of different files, which I have done in the past and
hated as it's impossible to find anything easily, but I was able to work around that. (It should be noted that I mentioned
my experience with multiple files in the past and he converted his [config to a single file](https://github.com/nickell/yadm/blob/4b057ddd343292f2f726336b4552a4231bd1cbf6/.config/nvim/init.lua)).

Without any further ado, let's dive into what this conversion gave me!

# I got a chance to switch up my plugins!

Since I was moving from Vimscript to Lua, it only made sense that I switch some of my old plugins to newer, actively
maintained Lua alternatives. Here are some packages I upgraded to.

## plug.vim ‚û°Ô∏è  [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

I like Packer's syntax and how I can inline package configs right next to how I install them. Since I started porting,
it seems that the new hotness is [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), which I suppose I will check out 3
years from now.

Packer seems to have the ability to "snapshot" configs that allow you to rollback in case package upgrades bork your
setup, but I haven't dived into that just yet.

## coc.nvim ‚û°Ô∏è Various LSP plugins

coc.nvim is pretty nice. It manages all of the language server stuff for you in it's own config format that is closer
to Visual Studio Code than Neovim. It was great when the Neovim LSP space was somewhat immature. Today though, Neovim's
LSP support is now first class it makes sense to use it directly.

_Unfortunately_, using Neovim's LSP directly does not free you from installing plugins. No, you will install many plugins
and like it. Luckily, they all seem to work together. Here's a sampling of said plugins:

- [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim): This manages the installation of the desired LSP plugins.
  Ex: Typescript server, linting, gopls.
- [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp): This is what powers all autocompletion prompts as you type. What makes
  this better than coc.nvim's completions is that it works when in insert mode, searching, command line completions and
  more!
- [null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim): This the glue that binds the LSPs that Mason installs
  to the editor. It's slightly annoying to get going if you don't read the docs (which I wasn't when copying the config),
  but once you do, you'll be like a Greek god of Vim.

Here's a video of it all at work. Notice all the code completion and the auto formatting. It really works great!

## ctrlp ‚û°Ô∏è [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

Telescope is a revelation! It's the single coolest thing that I introduced into my config in this sprint. It allows for
searching in all sorts of ways. I used to use ctrlp to do fuzzy path searching exclusively and was planning on continuing
to use it in this config, but ctrlp kept crashing this Vim setup like 20% of the time (and always when I hadn't saved
a file üò§). I decided to map `<Ctrl-p>` to Telescope's find files function. Not only does it work exactly the same,
I get a little preview of the file. And Telescope can search files for strings, search active buffers and more!

You have to see it to believe it!

# What was once a dream is now easy!

Lua is an actual scripting language that is fun to use, unlike Vimscript. As such, I was able to add custom functionality
that I would have struggled to add in Vimscript.

For example, I am a big fan of combining `set number relativenumber` such I can see the current line number and also
have the surrounding line numbers be the number of lines relative to the current line. This allows for easier composition
of linewise movements while knowing where the heck I am! But, sometimes I want normal line numbering and other times, I
want no numbering at all. I had a very nasty Vimscript function that could do this that I despised until I rewrote it in
Lua!

/>

Below is a video of me calling that function with <kbd>,rn</kbd> in normal mode.

  alt="Video showing the different Vim numbering modes being cycled through with ,rn"
/>

Another example is how I was able to finally make sense of my love of [Vim's `autochdir`](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Set_working_directory_to_the_current_file)
with how plugins work with it. I will let the following code block explain what I mean.

/>

For my final example, I technically had this working in Vimscript, but I really want to show it off! I am the biggest fan
of [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/) for dummy text. I made Vim function that call's it's HTTP API and inserts the copy
into the file!

<GithubFile
  url="https://github.com/eligundry/dots/blob/eeed2f2fcbf3c1aa02b6981e2abea746b1c50cd6/config/nvim/init.lua#L852-L857"
/>

By pressing <kbd>,hi</kbd>, I get a paragraph of the finest hipsum!

# Conclusion

Switching my Neovim config to Lua was a fun experience that yielded pretty big advances in how I work. I can search more
easily, I have more IDE features than I know what to do with and I definitely feel "with it."

At the same time, my Neovim still breaks randomly when I upgrade packages or Neovim itself. I still need to tend to it
like a garden. I wish I had chosen an editor that it more stable than what I have now, but like I said, I can't `:quit`
Vim!

Also, I just want to say goodbye to [Chad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadnickell/). He's moving on to bigger and better
things. He was responsible for hiring me at Chord and has been an absolute delight to work with. Best of luck, bud!
