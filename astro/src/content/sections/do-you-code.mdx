<h2 class="mb-4">Do You Code?</h2>

My life is all about making web applications. I am _the_ generalist you have in mind when you describe a
"full stack engineer" and can and will do everything to get a feature successfully to production. Query running slow?
Let me at it. Need a thoughtfully designed API? I can do that in my sleep. CSS needs some tweaking? As long as I don't
need to design it, I'll make it look great.

GitHub contribution calendars are not a good indicator of whether or not someone is a good developer, but they are very
pretty.
