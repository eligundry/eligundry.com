* I love AWS Lambda
  * So cheap
  * Really fun execution model
  * My ideal cloud is running a `Dockerfile` on Lambda
* I really _want_ to love Serverless
  * Supposedly a cloud agnostic way of running functions
  * On AWS Lambda, it's just a wrapper for CloudFormation
  * I really dislike CloudFormation
* CloudFormation ðŸ˜­
  * If you look at it wrong, it fails in ways that are impossible to undo
  * `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETED` = get fucked asshole
  * Adding/removing functions in Serverless breaks things in bad ways
  * For stability reasons, it just doesn't clean up after itself well. This leads to reliability for people that need
    it, so that's cool, it just is a hindrance for me.
* Decided to move my personal infrastructure to AWS
  * DigitalOcean was choice for years, but I'm just not seeing enough growth to justify using it.
  * AWS is not my favorite because of ethical reasons, but it's the devil I know.
