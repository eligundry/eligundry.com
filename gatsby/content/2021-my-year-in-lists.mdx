# Personal Accomplishments

## 1. Tech Leading a Whole Dang Website

After a decade of working in software engineering, I finally got a chance to call all the shots and tech lead a whole
project. Even though I didn't get "fancy" things like formal direct reports or a title change, I at least get to know
that I lead a team of mid-level engineers through a taxing project that turned out mostly great!

I won't formally mention the site here, [though you can visit it on the interwebs](https://www.zipjob.com). It is built
with Gatsby, Contentful, React, Go and hosted on AWS. This was just first in like 10 sites we were going to roll out
using this stack, but my job had different priorities and that did not come to pass like I would have liked. But hey,
that's life, treasure what you have done and look forward to the future!

## 3. Financial Security

[As I mentioned in a past post](/blog/adhd), I have had issues in the past around being poor. Some food insecurity, some
homelessness and that has stuck with me for years. Even after I moved to NYC and started making decent money, I would
still be worried about it going away in an instant.

At the beginning of the pandemic, my therapist and I worked on this and she gave me this great tool. It's called "then
what" and it goes like this:

* I lose my job... _and then what?_
* I don't have an income and need to dip into my savings... _and then what?_
* My savings will last me like two months... _and then what?_
* I could max out my credit cards and get like another 3 months... _and then what?_
* ...after 5 months I should have been able to land a job, this isn't even an issue.

With this situation handled mentally, I started to prepare to pump those numbers up. Between raises over the last year,
student loan payments being paused and a liquidity event at my job, I now have enough money to not work for 6 months
without having to touch my credit.

For the first time in my adult life, I'm not super worried about money. I know I can pay my bills, I know I'm not going
to starve. My concern is now outward, I want others to experience this security.

## 4. Writing Blog Posts That I Am Proud Of

I've always enjoyed writing, but since high school, I haven't had anything I felt like writing. I'd fill this hole in my
life 

# Disappointments

## 1. Getting COVID Twice

I got COVID in March and it knocked me out of work for two weeks. It was really bad, I couldn't leave my bed for so
long. Luckily, I didn't lose my sense of taste and I'm still alive, so silver linings, right? I also caught
a breakthrough in August that knocked me out of work for like two days. Wasn't too bad. Sadly, my lung capacity hasn't
fully recovered, but I also haven't pushed myself to recover.

## 2. Work Definitely Did Not Go As I Envisioned

I'm going to speak generally here as the details don't matter. It was painful to see a lot of my teammates move on to
other places and my employer had a different plan on hiring than I would have liked. Their plan will probably be
successful in the long term, just stunk for me.

All that is in the past, I quit mid-December and am currently looking for a job. I hope to have one that I love by the
end of January.

## 3. I Put Absolutely No Effort Into My Health

The biggest thing wrong with me right now is that I'm not as active as I should be. This not only effects me physically,
but mentally as well. I don't have any sort of workout other than walking around my neighborhood infrequently. That
needs to change next year.

I can pin this on a couple of things. Work has always been super demanding and I don't know when to quit. I was doing
some high intensity training right before the pandemic really got serious, but that was too intense for me (I would
frequently puke afterwards) and I ended up hating it.

What I need to find is an activity that I enjoy that will promote good cardio. Maybe an activity that will create
lasting friendships. Yes, exercise will fix all my issues, _he says knowing that is not true!_  The most attainable
goal, though, **needs to be me being able to walk up to my fourth story walk up apartment without getting winded!**

## 2. _CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST_ - Tyler, The Creator

<AlbumEmbed spotifyID="45ba6QAtNrdv6Ke4MFOKk9" className="float-right" />

In the year 2021, Tyler really put out a Gangsta Grillz tape. I did not have that on my bingo card for the year
because why would such an awesome thought cross my mind? Most importantly, it delivers in such a complete way that I'm
going to have trouble describing it.

Looking back on Tyler's previous albums, you got him rapping at a pretty high level up until _WOLF_ but doing and
edgelord persona, going experimental and taking risks on _CHERRY BOMB_ and getting to a great place mentally on _Flower
Boy_. Then came _IGOR_, which musically, I feel has a lot in common with _CHERRY BOMB_, but executed in a much more
enjoyable way. What could come next?

On _CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST_, he takes all the growth post _WOLF_, both personally and from a production standpoint, and
turns in a more rap focused album that has a little bit of everything. I personally love Tyler's heavier and soulful
songs, like _CORSO_, _LEMONHEAD_, _JUGGERNAUT_ and _MASSA_. It also has some of the best soul sample songs in his
discography, like _HOT WIND BLOWS_ and _SAFARI_. And if you really want some nice party songs to dance to, _SWEET
/ I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE_ is one of the best songs of the year.

What pushes this album over the edge for me is DJ Drama. I love when known DJs show up when you least expect it. Kid
Capri on Kendrick's _DAMN_. [_STN MTN_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9N0jwWUgw) is easily my favorite Childish
Gambino album because of Drama and it's format. In past albums, Tyler has had various alter egos that are more
braggadocios than him to speak his id. On _CMIYGL_, DJ Drama is that alter ego that talks all the shit and I am here for
it!

I love the brutal honesty on each song and am so happy that Tyler has found his way in the world. The Wes Anderson
styled video rollout was amazing. Could anyone have seen Odd Future still turning in classics & impacting culture at
this level a decade later?

## 3. _Pray For Hati_ - Mach-Hommy

/>

I've never sold drugs and I don't know a word of Hatian Creole, but all the same, I found this Mach-Hommy album
completely engrossing.

I'm baby craft beer thundercats hexagon skateboard. Jean shorts messenger bag austin brunch health goth chicharrones

## 4. _I Don't Hate You_ - Ogbert the Nerd

<AlbumEmbed 
  name="I Don't Hate You"

  url="https://ogbertthenerd.bandcamp.com/album/i-dont-hate-you"
  bandcampID="3305826138"
  className="float-right"
/>

Speaking of founding members of the "5th Wave Emo Committee", Ogbert the Nerd's _I Don't Hate You_ is one of my favorite
albums of last year that I completely missed. This album has real [Snowing][snowing] vibes which is perfect for when I'm
angry.

The lyrics are all about being an imperfect partner and being emotionally immature. These are topics I identify with and
constantly work on. It's maybe not the most healthy of music, but it is cathartic and identifiable for me sometimes.
A big theme of this album is apologizing for these imperfections, which is better than just being a shitbag.

In any case, if you're looking for an album with really good guitar work and people from Jersey screaming, look no
further!

## 5. _An Overview On Phenomenal Nature_ - Cassandra Jenkins

<AlbumEmbed

  artist="Cassandra Jenkins"
  url="https://cassandrajenkins.bandcamp.com/album/an-overview-on-phenomenal-nature"
  bandcampID="1892268450"
  className="float-right"
/>

Nostalgia never ceases to amaze me. When an artist is able clearly convey their nostalgia to a listener without any
context‚Ä¶ I get obsessed and just keep playing the album because it stirs up my nostalgia. A great example of this (and
the only album I can really compare this album to) is Bill Callahan's _Dream River_. This is probably an overly generic
description of all art and I'm dumb, but this is my blog so I'm saying it.

> A security guard<br />
> Stopped me to offer an overview on phenomenal nature<br />
> She said, "Sculpture is not just formed from penetration<br />
> You see, men have lost touch with the feminine"<br />
> And with her pink lipstick<br />
> And her Queens accent<br />
> She went on for a while about our president<br />
>
> \- Hard Drive

There are mundane moments in _An Overview On Phenomenal Nature_ that make me terribly emotional. I cannot listen to the
lyrics of _Hard Drive_ and not get tearful. On this song, there are just normal moments in a daily life that are sung so
beautifully that I get emotional. It's really undescribable to me.

Cassandra has an absolutely fantastic voice, the amount of smooth saxophone and guitar on this album really puts me in
a relaxing place and the lyrics are so poetic. It's fantastic focusing music as you can tune out the lyrics and relax,
but this album rewards reading the lyrics along with it. One of my goals for funemployment is to get a little high and
wander around the Ramble in Central Park listening to _The Ramble_.
