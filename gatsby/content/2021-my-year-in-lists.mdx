## 3. Financial Security

[As I mentioned in a past post](/blog/adhd), I have had issues in the past around being poor. Some food insecurity, some
homelessness and that has stuck with me for years. Even after I moved to NYC and started making decent money, I would
still be worried about it going away in an instant.

At the beginning of the pandemic, my therapist and I worked on this and she gave me this great tool. It's called "then
what" and it goes like this:

* I lose my job... _and then what?_
* I don't have an income and need to dip into my savings... _and then what?_
* My savings will last me like two months... _and then what?_
* I could max out my credit cards and get like another 3 months... _and then what?_
* ...after 5 months I should have been able to land a job, this isn't even an issue.

With this situation handled mentally, I started to prepare to pump those numbers up. Between raises over the last year,
student loan payments being paused and a liquidity event at my job, I now have enough money to not work for 6 months
without having to touch my credit.

For the first time in my adult life, I'm not super worried about money. I know I can pay my bills, I know I'm not going
to starve. My concern is now outward, I want others to experience this security.

# Disappointments

## 1. Getting COVID Twice

I got COVID in March and it knocked me out of work for two weeks. It was really bad, I couldn't leave my bed for so
long. Luckily, I didn't lose my sense of taste and I'm still alive, so silver linings, right? I also caught
a breakthrough in August that knocked me out of work for like two days. Wasn't too bad. Sadly, my lung capacity hasn't
fully recovered, but I also haven't pushed myself to recover.

## 2. Work Definitely Did Not Go As I Envisioned

I'm going to speak generally here as the details don't matter. It was painful to see a lot of my teammates move on to
other places and my employer had a different plan on hiring than I would have liked. Their plan will probably be
successful in the long term, just stunk for me.

All that is in the past, I put in my two weeks notice and am going to do a job search in January.

## 3. I Put Absolutely No Effort Into My Health

## 2. _CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST_ - Tyler, The Creator

<AlbumEmbed spotifyID="45ba6QAtNrdv6Ke4MFOKk9" className="float-right" />

In the year 2021, Tyler really put out a DJ Drama hosted mixtape. I did not have that on my bingo card for the year
because why would such an awesome thought cross my mind? Most importantly, it delivers in such a complete way that I'm
going to have trouble describing it.

Looking back on Tyler's previous albums, you got him rapping at a pretty high level up until _WOLF_ but doing and
edgelord persona, going experimental and taking risks on _CHERRY BOMB_ and getting to a great place mentally on _Flower
Boy_. Then came _IGOR_, which musically, I feel has a lot in common with _CHERRY BOMB_, but executed in a much more
enjoyable way. What could come next?

On _CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST_, he takes all the growth post _WOLF_, both personally and from a production standpoint, and
turns in a more rap focused album that has a little bit of everything. I personally love Tyler's heavier and soulful
songs, like _CORSO_, _LEMONHEAD_, _JUGGERNAUT_ and _MASSA_. It also has some of the best soul sample songs in his
discography, like _HOT WIND BLOWS_ and _SAFARI_. And if you really want some nice party songs to dance to, _SWEET
/ I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE_ is one of the best songs of the year.

What pushes this album over the edge for me is DJ Drama. I love when known DJs show up when you least expect it. Kid
Capri on Kendrick's _DAMN_. [_STN MTN_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9N0jwWUgw) is easily my favorite Childish
Gambino album because of Drama and it's format. In past albums, Tyler has had various alter egos that are more
braggadocios than him to speak his id. On _CMIYGL_, DJ Drama is that alter ego that talks all the shit and I am here for
it!

I love the brutal honesty on each song and am so happy that Tyler has found his way in the world. Could anyone have seen
Odd Future still turning in classics a decade later?

## 7. _Half God_ - Wiki

  bandcampID="2800528835"
  className="float-right"
/>

Wiki has been one of my favorite rappers for years. [_No Mountains In Manhattan_][nmim] was the perfect love letter to
NYC and Ratking's [_So It Goes_][so-it-goes] is my personal favorite walking in NYC in the winter album. When I learned
that he was doing a whole album produced by [Navy Blue][navy-blue] I got very excited!

## 8. _GLOW ON_ - Turnstile

<AlbumEmbed spotifyID="2NrYPcMmQBlbBxopc2XlzS" className="float-right" />

Even though I love emo music, I'm not the biggest fan of super heavy music. Metal doesn't do it for me and I frequently
avoid hardcore music. So it was very much a surprise to me how much I loved _GLOW ON_ from Turnstile.

## 9. _Live Forever_ - Bartees Strange
