> Trigger warning: I talk about suicide and depression in this post.

# 1. The Beginning

I was 6 years old, in first grade. My teacher told my mom that I couldn't sit still and was disruptive. My mom is
a special educator and takes me to the doctor at which point I am diagnosed with  <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> 
and put on Ritalin.

The Ritalin helps with the focus and gives me a lot of energy! Being 6 years old, I don't really understand what this
ADHD is all about, I just want to play outside and run around with all this energy. I mean sure, I have to go to the
principal's office every day at 2pm to get another Ritalin, but I feel like I'm a normal kid.

My mom, being the special educator that she is and knowing the system like she does, gets my school to carve out little
accommodations for me. At the time, I didn't think things like taking standardized tests outside of the normal classroom
was helpful. I feel like I would have been fine taking those tests in the classroom, but whatever, I'm told that people
with ADHD have trouble taking tests if things like doors open unexpectedly?

Every couple of years, I switch medications. Ritalin was fine through elementary school but we switched to Adderall (I
think that gave me some weird heart beats), back to an extended release Ritalin (longer release means I don't need
a pick me up in the afternoon), before settling on Concerta (extended release and no heart issues).

It goes on like this through high school. I'm told that I'm smart and put in the gifted classes but my GPA is always
around 3.0. I get a computer when I'm 15 and it's off to the races. I could sit in front of that box for hours devouring
information. Tech blogs, gaming sites, and the old StumbleUpon extension opened my mind to so many possibilities in the
world. I end up going to a vocational school to learn how to do video editing / graphic design / web design and fall in
love with making websites.

# 2. Early Adulthood

I turn 18 and realize that I'm extremely unhappy. Thoughts of suicide unhappy. I decided that needed to change and
started going to a therapist/psychiatrist. Talk therapy was (and continues to be) very helpful and they put me on an
anti-depressant called Celexa. The sadness goes away somewhat but I'm still stressed.

I start attending a technical school that was associated with the vocational school for web development. The first
semester there, I do great! I balancing a full course load with a part time job at RadioShack. But then the job at
RadioShack goes away and I have get a job doing computer repair for internet cafes. That job is a lot more demanding and
it's paying me money so I let school slide and fail all my classes.

Next fall, I enroll in an actual college and get an internship doing web development and the cycle repeats itself.
I prioritize work over school, I flunk my classes, get extremely stressed and angry at myself for not being able to do
both. And this cycle repeats itself for 5 years! I was constantly employed that entire time, often not making enough
money to survive, and flunking classes.

        work with some very nice and cool people in Cleveland.

Along with being poor came bouts of food insecurity and homelessness. Those bouts were short but how have they stuck
with me over the years. The only solution I have found to those problems is having a bunch of money. Without money,
I would still be freaking out about those problems.

How did I deal with this stress? I started smoking (did not help the money situation one bit) and drinking a bunch. On
both of those vices, the ADHD medication only made things worse. ADHD medications are speed and speed goes great with
beer and cigarettes. I have since noticed that when I was on them, I would drink and chain smoke like I wouldn't when
I was off.

        facial hair.

After 4 years of this, **I hit my rock bottom**. I was working in a computer repair shop and sometimes going to classes
during the day and attempting to start a web consulting company with some friends at night. I was burning the candle at
both ends and during the weekends, I would literally work 24-48 hours straight for a stretch. I was unbelivably stressed
out and one night Tweeted something about jumping off a bridge. My Tweets cross posted to Facebook and my parents saw
it.

The next morning, my dad shows up at my apartment and says "Son, we're going to the hospital". I hop in the car, go to
the ER for a check up before being checked into a weekend stay at the local mental hospital. I'm sure that a lot of
people have horror stories about mental hospitals, but I don't have one. It was a very relaxing stay. I got to wear
a gown all weekend and shared a room with a friendly guy that had a drinking problem that seemed to make him a mean
drunk. They put me on a nicotine patch because I wasn't allowed to smoke. You're not supposed to sleep with those one
but I did anyways and had the most vivid and trippiest dreams ever. 

Most importantly, during this weekend in the hospital, we adjusted my anti-depressants from Celexa to **Wellbutrion** and
**Remeron**. We will get to the Wellbutrion in the next section, but the Remeron ended up being the biggest improvement
in my life. I take it at night and in an hour or two, I'm asleep and stay asleep for around 8 hours a night. Before
then, my obsessions and stresses could keep me up for hours.

# 3. Thriving

After my stay in the mental hospital, I have some tough conversations about my workload. I had to quit working on the
side business with my friends and started working more hours at the computer repair shop with the hope that I could pay
my bills while I try to finish school. Eventually, I switch to a web development job at a local company, but staying in
school was too hard for me to swing while working and I had to drop out.

Then, in 2015, I was contacted by a consulting company in NYC offering to move me out there to work for them. I quickly
took that offer as it was much more than what I could make in Ohio and NYC is a lot more age appropriate for a 25 year
old than a college town. I quickly become one of the better engineers on the team and just thrive at that job.

Mentally, I find a good therapist and finally go off my ADHD medication. Going off that medication caused me to gain
some weight that I haven't gotten close to shedding, but hey, at least I'm not on speed anymore!

I fall in love with someone special and we move in together in February 2020 and then... COVID happens üòÇ.
