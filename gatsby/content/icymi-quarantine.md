I'm gonna veer off my normal course of grooveable music into something a little
more personal. This week, I'm gonna suggest that people check out my favorite
ambient album ever, [Laurel Halo's *Quarantine*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XARRzHIiZ3SyXEQEaWQ32).

Halo is an artist that is currently on Hyperdub. She usually makes typical
Hyperdub fair, which is like somewhat dark and minimal dance music. But, on this
album, and only on this album, does she break that mold and decides to sing over
her somewhat ominous beats. Her voice on this album is **incredible**. Rather
than just use her normal voice, she layers and the vocals such that they
harmonize. On first listen, this can work really good on some of the songs, like
Thaw, but can seem super weird on a song like Years. Notice how I said that they
that it can seem weird on first listen. Some of the harmonies are ugly because
of the subject manner that this album deals with.

This album is about a break up. They type of break up where you kinda of know
that it's not working but you don't want to be alone. On Years, you have the
break up talk where Laurel plays both the parties in the relationship. The
vocals are ugly and can be a little uncomfortable to listen to.

But holy shit is it worth it because you get the album's highlight next, which
is *Thaw*. The beat is super simple with a lot of static around it for about two
minutes and then her voice kicks in. I don't really know how to describe it, but
she's harmonizing with about 5 different pitches of her voice at points. This is
the personal narrative that she has to tell herself to get through the break up.

From there, the rest of the album plays out sorta like the five stages of grief
and the rest of the songs blur together in a fantastic fashion, ending with
acceptance on Light + Space. Because it's an ambient album, you may not pick up
on the subtleties of this album on the first listen, because well, it's ambient.
But this album rewards repeated listens like no other. Also, like a break up, it
may not make sense at the time, but you'll be better off because of it.

Finally, I'd love to talk about this album's cover, which I think might be
my favorite of all time.

[Pitchfork has an interview with Halo and the artist about this cover](http://pitchfork.com/features/take-cover/8859-laurel-halo/) this almost
serves as a companion piece to the album. It's an interesting read, so if you
dig the album, be sure to check it out.

Overall, this might be one of my favorite albums of all time. Because it's
ambient, I'm perfectly fine playing it as I go to sleep or while I work. But
when I do play it, I notice something new each time. I don't understand why
you're still reading it, give it a chance and don't give up until the end of
track 3 because it will all make sense in the end
