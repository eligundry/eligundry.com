I graduated high school in 2009. Graduated right into the Great Recession. All the money that my parents' saved for my
college education rapidly shrunk. In order to have a car on the road and go to school, I needed to work 30-40 hours
a week. So, I got a job selling things at RadioShack and that was fine for a while. I was able to balance school and
sell cell phones no problem. But that job went away cause I was giving too many discounts. Gotta make those sales!
_Technically_, they expected me to pay them $500 in order to prevent criminal charges being pressed, but I never paid
that and [I don't think they're gonna press me on that anymore][rs-bankruptcy].

In any case, I needed a job fast and I really wanted something in <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>. So
I hoped on Craigslist and answered a job ad for a traveling IT technician. The interview was at a Panera and it went
swimingly and I accepted on the spot. The next day, I got to see how janky an operation that hires off Craigslist is.
They had moved a retail computer repair operation into a house. One of the technicians made a sub attic in the attic
that he was living in. They had a "recycling center" in an abandoned warehouse that was definitely unsafe to be in. They
had this high school student sanding down the insides of refurbished monitors so that a resistive touch screen could be
fitted into it. **The whole thing was gross, but hey, I needed money.**

The primary client for this IT company were internet cafes. You may have a vision of internet cafes as a places in China
for people to play video games and surf the web in a social setting. The internet cafes in Ohio were not too far from
that, I suppose, with one major exception: **they are places for people to gamble.** The games they were playing were
low tech video slots and instead of paying per game, they paid for time on the machines. This made the gambling legal by
Ohio state laws but illegal under federal law. In practice, the FBI would raid these establishments frequently, sieze
all the assets, and we would replace the machines with refurbished ThinkCenteres and the sanded down touch screens. No
sense in paying for the best if it's gonna get yanked in 3 months.

The day to day was always drama filled and exciting. You drive to Sandusky to replace a switch. You drive to Cleveland
Heights to setup a new cafe. You learn to make patch cables, you learn more about networking and scripting. You get in
arguments about how much gas money you should be reimbursed for driving to all those sites. Lots of 16 hour days cause
it has to get done now now now. Typical IT shit.

What's a little different from a typical IT job is... the customers paying your bills are somewhat unsavory. And _their_
customers are all poor people trying to turn a dollar into $10 knowing full well that the deck is stacked against them.
**Just addicted to these slot machines.** **But hey, you need _their_ money so you can keep a car on the road, so it's
okay, there's no issue here.**

I've always been a smart ass that asks the questions that shouldn't be asked. One time, I'm on site and talking to one
of our clients. He's looking for a computer that when he turns it off, all the data disappears. Okay, no problem, get
him a souped up computer with USB 3 so that he can run a live Linux image. Easy. But then I do what I always do which is
ask why:

> Me: Why do you need a computer that has all the data disappear?
>
> Him: I'm a bookie and that data needs to get gone if the cops show up.
>
> Me: Oh, so you must have a guy that breaks legs?
>
> Him: Yes, but that isn't a good first pass at collecting. Gotta work up to that.

As you go to leave, he hits you with $100 and a wink. You know now that this is dead ass serious, but like all things
when I was young, I didn't learn. **But hey, that's $100 I didn't have before, again, no issues here.**

Well, a few weeks later, the IT job goes sideways. We weren't making enough money, my boss institutes that the day will
start at 6am and end when the job is done. And now we can't pay for all the gas that you need to drive to and from
sites.
