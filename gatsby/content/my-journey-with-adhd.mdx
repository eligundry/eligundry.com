A play in three acts.

# 1. The Beginning

I was 6 years old, in first grade. My teacher told my mom that I couldn't sit still and was disruptive. My mom is
a special educator and takes me to the doctor at which point I am diagnosed with  <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> 
and put on Ritalin.

The Ritalin helps with the focus and gives me a lot of energy! Being 6 years old, I don't really understand what this
ADHD is all about, I just want to play outside and run around with all this energy. I mean sure, I have to go to the
principal's office every day at 2pm to get another Ritalin, but I feel like I'm a normal kid.

My mom, being the special educator that she is and knowing the system like she does, gets my school to carve out little
accommodations for me. At the time, I didn't think things like taking standardized tests outside of the normal classroom
was helpful. I feel like I would have been fine taking those tests in the classroom, but whatever, I'm told that people
with ADHD have trouble taking tests if things like doors open unexpectedly?

Every couple of years, I switch medications. Ritalin was fine through elementary school but we switched to Adderall (I
think that gave me some weird heart beats), back to an extended release Ritalin (longer release means I don't need
a pick me up in the afternoon), before settling on Concerta (extended release and no heart issues).

It goes on like this through high school. I'm told that I'm smart and put in the gifted classes but my GPA is always
around 3.0. I get a computer when I'm 15 and it's off to the races. I could sit in front of that box for hours devouring
information. Tech blogs, gaming sites, and the old StumbleUpon extension opened my mind to so many possibilities in the
world. I end up going to a vocational school to learn how to do video editing / graphic design / web design and fall in
love with making websites.

# 2. Early Adulthood

I turn 18 and realize that I'm extremely unhappy. Thoughts of suicide unhappy. I decided that needed to change and
started going to a therapist/psychiatrist. Talk therapy was (and continues to be) very helpful and they put me on an
anti-depressant called Celexa. The sadness goes away somewhat but I'm still stressed.

I start attending a technical school that was associated with the vocational school for web development. The first
semester there, I do great! I balancing a full course load with a part time job at RadioShack. But then the job at
RadioShack goes away and I have get a job doing computer repair for internet cafes. That job is a lot more demanding and
it's paying me money so I let school slide and fail all my classes.

Next fall, I enroll in an actual college and get an internship doing web development and the cycle repeats itself.
I prioritize work over school, I flunk my classes, get extremely stressed and angry at myself for not being able to do
both. And this cycle repeats itself for 5 years! I was constantly employed that entire time, often not making enough
money to survive, and flunking classes.

Along with being poor came bouts of food insecurity and homelessness. Those bouts were short but how have they stuck
with me over the years. The only solution I have found to those problems is having a bunch of money. Without money,
I would still be freaking out about those problems.

How did I deal with this stress? I started smoking (did not help the money situation one bit) and drinking a bunch. On
both of those vices, the ADHD medication only made things worse. ADHD medications are speed and speed goes great with
beer and cigarettes. I have since noticed that when I was on them, I would drink and chain smoke like I wouldn't when
I was off.
