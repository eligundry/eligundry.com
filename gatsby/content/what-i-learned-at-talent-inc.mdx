Today is my last day working at [Talent Inc](https://talentinc.com/). I've been there for 4 years, which is the longest
I have ever held a job and it's the first product startup I've ever worked at. I feel extremely lucky for this
experience and I would like the opportunity to share some lessons I learned.

## Having Good Users Is a Blessing, Give Them Powerful Tools

When I first started at Talent Inc, I was working on software that was used by our internal operational team. I was
paired up with an engineer that had been with the company for forever through an acquisition. In my first month working
there he said something that has stuck with me for ever since:

> We have the best users, we have to treat them right.

I could not put it better myself. That operational team works with job seekers whom can understandably be demanding. Job
searching is in the top 3 most stressful moments of their lives. What's incredible about both of these user groups
(customers & staff) is how kind and helpful they can be when something breaks. How creative they can be when a fix is
delayed to get the job done. This made my life so much easier and less stressful when the chips were down.

How can I reward this team effort? I was lucky during my tenure at Talent Inc many opportunities to build systems from
the ground up to empower these users. I feel that we delivered on those opportunities and the fact that we exited kind
of validates that belief.

## So Many Data Pipelines

All my jobs previous to this were mostly at consulting firms. One thing I can tell you about consulting is that you are
somewhat separated from the end user. My joke about my consulting is the main problem you are solving is getting that
next check to show up. As such, your users can become adversaries in your mind. You get okay with dropping events.

The concerns are different when you work at a customer focused startup though.
