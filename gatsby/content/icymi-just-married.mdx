Y'all, I love emo music. As you can tell, I have a [range of emotions](/feelings) and I have "sad boi" tendencies for
sure. So this shouldn't love of emo music shouldn't come as a surprise. All the same, I'm here to tell you that emo gets
a bad rap.

When you think of emo music, you probably think about those bands from the mid-2000s like My Chemical Romance or Panic
At The Disco. Music for dramatic theatre kids. And sure, those are emo bands, but they are just one era of emo! I would
argue that those bands made some good music BUT it's definetely not the apex of the genre.

The emo music that you're thinking of is what is called the "second wave". The first wave was in the 90s with bands like
Cap'n Jazz, Sunny Day Real Estate, American Football, and so on. The first wave has lots of good music that has aged
pretty well. The second wave is the pop apex of emo with the bands listed above. The third wave, also called **emo
revival** is what I want to talk about today. It ran from the late 2000s to early 2010s and harkened back to the first
wave of emo.

All art reflects the tastes of the time, third wave emo is no different. Musically, to me at least, it sounds lot like
the rest of indie rock of that time period.
