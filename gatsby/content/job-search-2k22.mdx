At the end of 2021, [I left my job at Talent Inc.][goodbye-talentinc] and conducted an extremely thorough job search. I really prefer to job
search without a day job so that I can give it my full focus. Today, I am happy to announce that after a little over
a month of interviewing, I found the perfect job for me. But, before I get to that, I really want to talk about how
I conducted my job search as it's been something I've been planning for a bit.

This job market is wild! I can't tell if companies are hiring harder this cycle or if the fact that my last role was
"senior software engineer" at a startup or what. This cycle could not have gone any more different than my last job
search in 2017. 

Let's take a quick at conversion rates:

* **TODO: 2022 percentages need updating at the end of this week**
* Application → callback rate was 75% in 2022 vs 35% in 2017
* Application → code test rate was 40% in 2022 vs 9% in 2017
* Application → on site rate was 24% in 2022 vs 6% in 2017
* Application → offer rate was 5% in 2022 vs 1% in 2017

The numbers don't tell the full story here either! The later stage numbers here are weighed down by the fact that I was
able to drop out of processes later on if I wasn't getting good vibes from the company. That freedom alone allowed me to
have a little more swagger in walking into interviews.

# "Technology Enabled Job Search"

With working at a job focused on job seekers, I had four years to think about how I would approach my own job search.
A big one that I thought about was how to effectively track open rates of emails and my website. So, I went about wiring
my resume and email signature to append `utm` parameters to all the links to my website. My thought here was that
a click through to my site would lead to a more positive outcome on initial submission.

**This turned out to not work at all! I only got 3 visitors to the site from clicks in my email signature or resume
links.** Making unique copies of my resume and updating my signature on all my emails was seriously annoying, so this
defintely is not worth the effort. 

I did get elevated traffic to my website during my job search, though. It seems that I can attribute this increase from
the fact that I did post some blog posts on LinkedIn. My last blog post was brought up a few times 

# Enough about the search! Where are you working!?
