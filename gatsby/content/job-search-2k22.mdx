At the end of 2021, [I left my job at Talent Inc.][goodbye-talentinc] and conducted an extremely thorough job search. I really prefer to job
search without a day job so that I can give it my full focus. Today, I am happy to announce that after a little over
a month of interviewing, I found the perfect job for me. But, before I get to that, I really want to talk about how
I conducted my job search as it's been something I've been planning for a bit.

# Enough about the search! Where are you working!?

TBD
