I think we can all agree that [Comcast's acquisition of Time Warner
Cable](http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/13/5407932/comcast-and-time-warner-a-very-dark-cloud-with-a-tiny-silver-lining)
is a scary thing for consumers. This merger will impact their choices and
probably net neutrality as a whole. That said, I think the FTC could impose
one simple rule that would help consumers as whole.

Look back at the [Verizion-Alltel merger back in
2008](http://consumerist.com/2013/01/22/att-to-buy-alltel-wait-didnt-verizon-already-buy-alltel/).
As part of the deal, Verizion had to divest itself from certain markets and sell
them to a third party. As someone who grew up in one of these markets (Rural
Ohio) and sold wireless at the time, this was a very good thing for consumers.
They had one more company to choose from, which is unarguably, a very good
thing. I lost many sales to Alltel all the time because their rates were so low
(benefits of having an established network and lowered operating costs,
I suppose).

## Proposal

I'm tired of not having a choice of ISPs when it comes time to move. I plead that
the FTC treat the Comcast-TWC merger like the Verizion-Alltel acquisition. In
markets where there are high concentrations of both Comcast and TWC subscribers, there
should be an auction to sell TWC's holdings there to an interested third party.

This would allow for new ISPs to pop up left and right with lower startup cost
than normal, increasing competition in markets where there was previously none.
Short of rejecting the Comcast-TWC acquisition, this is the only safe way to
broker this deal so that it's fair to consumers.
